# Memory Card Game

## Project Purpose:

This game was built as a Udacity Course project for Intro to Programming (Front End).

## How to Load the game


- Play on GitHub.io: **[Memory Card Game](https://github.com/elopez01/elopez01.github.io.git)**

### How to Play the Game

The game board consists of sixteen random cards in a grid, each with different symbols on one side.

On each turn:

- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over and moves counter adds one
- If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state and moves counter adds one
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.


### Special Features

- The game features a timer to keep track of how long it takes to win and reports time on win screen
- The player starts out with a three star rating -- but the rating drops the more moves it take to complete the game 
	- 3 stars 20 or less moves
	- 2 stars between 21 and 30 moves
	- 1 star 30 or more moves
- When the game ends, a pop-up appears with the elapsed time, final star rating and a play again button
